Go to the bot tab create the bot then copy the token and store it somewhere
Click the OAuth2 tab then scroll down and click the bot button then set the permissions you want your bot to have, I used Administrator because yes.

Doing this is as simple as opening the folder of the bot and in the terminal use the following command npm install discord.js
After doing all the steps you will be able to use the code provided you can fork it, do whatever essentially

# Using

It should start from there if they are any bugs that are related to what is currently in the github then create an issue the tab is next to the code
